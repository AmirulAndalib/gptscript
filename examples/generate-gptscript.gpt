tools: sys.find, sys.read, sys.write, sys.exec

I have a new tool called gptscript. You can find information about it here in this folder
by looking at *.gpt files and the README.md file. The examples folder should be particularly helpful.

Do the following:

1. Search through the *.gpt files and README.md in order to learn how gptscript works.
2. Write a new gptscript file called myfile.gpt that uses the sys.write tool to write the first 10
   numbers in the Fibonacci sequence to a file called fibonacci.txt.
3. Execute the myfile.gpt script by running the following command: gptscript myfile.gpt
